# Dougie's Portfolio

Welcome to my professional software-development portfolio!

My name is Derek Douglas, aka Dougie. I'm a full-stack developer, specializing in JavaScript, React, HTML5, and CSS, with a background in linguistics and leadership development.

My passion is developing intuitive, easy-to-use software that makes people's lives a bit easier so that they can focus on what they are passionate about.
